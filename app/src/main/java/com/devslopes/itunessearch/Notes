*Im not parsing the server response to objects, im just
making a list of objects from the server.

*changed the adapter parameter for list from String to ItunesServerMovies

*search Button in search View , appears when user select or writes something
in searchView, its not to much visible but i think its better than a FAB

*cant get to clear list update adapter/recycler with searchview/search button,
with FAB it did work. cant set search term to null, and empty string does not
work. i cleared the list im passing to the adapter and notify data changed ,
it does not work
